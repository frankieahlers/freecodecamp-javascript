/* JavaScript has 8 different data types:
- undefined
- null
- boolean
- string
- symbol
- bigint
- number
- object 

12 is a number, while "12" is a string.

Variables represent the data we want to refer to, just like the x or y variables 
in mathematics. They can store different values at different times!
